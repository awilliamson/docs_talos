# Introduction

Welcome to Talos! You can use Talos for hyperparameter optimization with Keras models. Talos allows you to use Keras models exactly as you would otherwise, and is built for and tested on Python 2 and 3.

> To install stable:

```shell
pip install talos
```
> Latest dev version:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/autonomio/talos.git@daily-dev
```

Talos incorporates grid, random, and probabilistic hyperparameter optimization strategies, with focus on maximizing the flexibility, efficiency, and result of random strategy. Talos users benefit from access to pseudo, quasi, true, and quantum random methods.  

Talos provides a fully automated *POD* (Prepare, Optimize, Deploy) pipeline that consistently yields state-of-the-art prediction results in a wide-range of prediction problems.

Talos is maintained by a non-profit foundation with 501(c)(3) status. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/autonomio/talos).
